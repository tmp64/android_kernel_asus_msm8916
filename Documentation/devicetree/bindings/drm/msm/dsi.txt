Qualcomm Technologies Inc. adreno/snapdragon DSI output

Required properties:
- compatible:
  * "qcom,mdss-dsi-ctrl"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of controller, PLL,
  PHY and PHY regulator
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "dsi_ctrl"
  * "dsi_pll"
  * "dsi_phy"
  * "dsi_phy_regulator"
- qcom,dsi-host-index: The ID of DSI controller hardware instance. This should
  be 0 or 1, since we have 2 DSI controllers at most for now.
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the DSI block.
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required:
  * "bus_clk"
  * "byte_clk"
  * "core_clk"
  * "core_mmss_clk"
  * "iface_clk"
  * "mdp_core_clk"
  * "pixel_clk"
- #clock-cells: The value should be 1.
- vdd-supply: phandle to vdd regulator device node
- vddio-supply: phandle to vdd-io regulator device node
- vdda-supply: phandle to vdda regulator device node

Optional properties:
- panel@0: Node of panel connected to this DSI controller.
  See files in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/ for each supported
  panel.
- qcom,dual-panel-mode: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
  driving a panel which needs 2 DSI links.
- qcom,master-panel: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is driving
  the master link of the 2-DSI panel.
- qcom,sync-dual-panel: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
  driving a 2-DSI panel whose 2 links need receive command simultaneously.
- interrupt-parent: phandle to the MDP block if the interrupt signal is routed
  through MDP block
